The required text for the course is Albert. _Quantum Mechanics and Experience_. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992. ISBN: 0674741129.

Hughes, R. I. G. _The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics_. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989. ISBN: 0674843916.

Maudlin. _Quantum Non-locality and Relativity: Metaphysical Intimations of Modern Physics_. Malden, MA: Blackwell, c2002. ISBN: 0631232214. (Highly recommended)

Additional readings (usually articles) will be handed out in class at various points throughout the course.

**The material is, in most cases, trickier than meets the eye; read it twice.**
